# 🤼 Discussions

Open discussions with @mazipan, you can ask me any questions, ask about my projects, ask my opinions for something that you still not sure, share your ideas, share something new in the industry, maybe share some of your cool project also with me.
I also open with any non-technical discussions, about career, learning tricks, education, or just asking for a random motivation booster for example.
